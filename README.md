# RSA Booster - Free Groq API

**Acknowledgment:** This script is based on the work of [Francesco Cifardi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/francescocifardi/). Without his original script, this enhanced version would not have been possible. Special thanks to Francesco for his contribution and inspiration.

This enhanced Google Apps Script, created by me - [Dawid Å»urawski](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dawid-%C5%BCurawski-61a1341b3/), improves upon the original functionality, integrating with Google Sheets to generate alternative ad assets for Responsive Search Ads (RSAs) using the Groq API.

## Features

- **Custom Menu:** Adds a "RSA Booster - Free Groq API" menu to your Google Sheet.
- **AI Model Selection:** Choose from a predefined list of AI models for generating alternatives.
- **Automatic Asset Processing:** Identifies low-performing ad assets and generates three engaging alternatives for each.
- **Results Saved in Sheets:** Outputs the generated alternatives to a "New Assets" sheet.
